## Work introduction
This is the current work we are working on. We use deep learning to predict RNA sture score.

## Methods
We have used several machine learning models and deep learning models including CNN and RNN to predict.
### image methods
we have tried a different method to predict, we convert sequences to image and predict images using 2D image models including U-net and MSDCNN(dilated convolution)
